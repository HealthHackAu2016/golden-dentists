# Golden dentists

Fair pricing in a market that doesn’t have it.

There is a pricing asymmetry in the market for dental services. Dentists are unwilling to share how much their services cost, except within themselves.

# Why is the problem important?

Hidden prices prevent healthy price competition between dentists, lead to patient dissatisfaction, and discourage patients from taking cheap and efficient preventive check-ups due to the fear of being ripped off later on.  According to research, affordability is a major barrier preventing Australians from visiting the dentist.

# Why is this problem not already solved?

Price advertising is known to reduce market prices, which is good for patients but not for dentists. Dentists don’t have an incentive to publicise price information as patients are less likely to switch to an alternative dentist if they are unaware of available prices. 

# Why does our solution work?

Patients have an incentive to find out price information but they didn’t have the incentive and an easy way to share price information they already have with other patients. We developed a mechanism that enables and encourages patients to upload the invoices they have been given by their dentists. 

# How does our solution scale to other services?

Lack of price transparency is a problem in several markets for professional service providers such as car mechanics, lawyers, general health practitioners, financial advisors, contractors and so on. Our solution can be easily be extended to these services.
