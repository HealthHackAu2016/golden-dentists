problem:
- lack of price transparency in the market for dental services
- imbalance of information: dentists know their and their competitors prices, patients don’t know anything //?

why is lack of price transparency a problem?
- prevents healthy competition between dentists
- leads to patient dissatisfaction
- discourage patients from taking cheap and efficient preventive check-ups
- According to research, affordability is a major barrier preventing Australians from visiting the dentist.
- over charging is a problem: Dr Micheal Foley

why isn’t this problem solved already? //? unclear
- the problem with doctor reviews - Dr Micheal Foley 
- dentists can’t give “quotes” to people (answer: “it depends”)
- the ADA survey isn’t public and only gives average state based prices

what is our solution
- analogy of our solution: it’s Glassdoor for dentist costs
- enables and encourages patients to upload the invoices they have been given by their dentists. 
- allows patients to compare dentist prices

why do we use receipts: 
	- patient owned data
	- verified costs against medicare codes: It’s credible information
	- people have always shared this info, we’ve just made that a lot easier
	- actual cost is objective; reviews are subjective

our solution demo

- Use case: I am a new patient. I want to search for dentists and see what general costs are
- Use case: I am a patient with a dentist. I want to see how my dentist bill compares to the market
- demo notes
	- photos converted to PDF and information scrapped from PDF are solved 	problems. The set of documents in this case are very narrow in 	difference: dentist receipts

why our solution works to solve the problem
- enables and encourages patients to upload the invoices they have been given by their dentists. 
- leads to full price transparency 
- open pricing won’t punish dentists
	- patients are more likely to seek treatment if they know costs
	- dentist reputation and quality can be priced
	- there is a pressure for dentists to treat efficiently to keep their pricing low
	- verified receipts means an audit trail to check: no self reports
-evidence from the Netherlands suggest that price transparency 

how this scales out
- there are lots of markets where the information is unbalanced which a solution like this can assist to bring balance to pricing by aligning incentives better for both providers and consumers
	- other medical markets where pricing information is complex and hard to accurately provide from the service providers
	- mechanical repairs, legal services, 

team experience //?
- we all learnt a lot more about the dental profession and the problems dentists face: It’s not a simple case of dentists are overcharging; it’s more complex
- this is a team built solution. We started with a team formed on Saturday and together we researched and worked out the solution (show picture of board).
