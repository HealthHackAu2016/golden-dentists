Pitch structure - Andrew copy


why is this a problem?
- explain the imbalance of information
	- incentive to over treat and charge is high > no pressure the other way
- how lack of pricing information impact service delivery and people's health
- inefficient markets are bad for all players: not just consumers
- over treatment is a problem: Dr Micheal Foley


why isn't this solved already?
- the problem with medical professional review services - Dr Micheal Foley
- dentists can't give "quotes" to people
- the ADA survey isn't public


why our solution works to solve the problem
- the benefits of an efficient market: the right incentives
- analogy of our solution: it's Glassdoor for dentist costs
- why use reciepts: 
	- paitent owned data
	- verified costs against medicare codes: It's credible information
	- people have always shared this info, we've just made that a lot easier
	- actual cost is objective; reviews are subjective
- open pricing won't punish dentists
	- paitients are more likely to seek treatment if they know costs
	- dentist reputation and quality can be priced
	- there is a pressure for dentists to treat efficiently to keep their 		pricing low
	- verified reciepts means an audit trail to check: no self reports


our solution demo
- Use case: I am a paitient. I want to see how my dentist bill compares to the market
- Use case: I am a paitient. I want to search for dentists and see what general costs are
- demo notes
	- photos coverted to PDF and information scrapped from PDF are solved 	problems. The set of documents in this case are very narrow in 	difference: dentist reciepts
	- we'd like to show pricing trends: trending up or down


how this scales out
- there are lots of markets where the information is unbalanced which a solution like this can assist to bring balance to pricing by aligning incentives better for both providers and consumers
	- other medical markets where pricing information is complex and hard to 	accurately provide from the service providers
	- mechanical repairs: information is complex and variable. There is a 	lack of understanding from a the consumer about the market. 



team experience
- we all learnt a lot more about the dental profession and the problems dentists face: It's not a simple case of dentists are overcharging; it's more complex
- this is a team built solution. We started with a team formed on Saturday and together we researched and worked out the solution (show picture of board).
